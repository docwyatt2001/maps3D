Maps3D
========
## What is it?
Maps3D is a web app to calculate the topography (elevation profile) of a map section in Google Maps as a 3D-Model.

## What CAN I do with it?
* define a rectangular map extract to calculate the profile for
* set the precision of the profile (i.e. how many points the elevation will be retrieved)
* rotate/zoom the profile

## What CAN'T I do with it
* define shapes other than rectangular to define the map extract
* show points on the map
* print the model on a 3D-Printer
* use the app as a flight simulator

## Where can I try it out?
You can try out the current state [here][web-app]

## Anything else?
